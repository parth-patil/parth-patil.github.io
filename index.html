            <h4>Ad Server :          </h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Worked in a team of 3 developers to design and implement an ad server platform from scratch written in scala and built using finagle and scala actors.</li>
              <li>I was responsible for implementing the data service part of the ad server whose job it is to fetch the data needed by ad server to serve ads.</li>
              <li>The data service does its job by employing several actors that work in parallel.</li>
              <li>Data is fetched from various sources (kafka, log files, Mysql, HBase), transformed and then loaded into Redis where it can be used by the ad server. Advanced</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Advanced Analytics Platform for AdSystem :     </h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Designed and implemented an advanced analytics solution that is used by ad system customers.</li>
              <li>The reporting system allows for flexible grouping and filtering of massive amounts of data in real time.</li>

              <li>The report data is queried through a PHP library that talks to HBase over Thrift.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Real time Notification Platform :</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Lead a group of 6 engineers to create a functional prototype of a real time notification platform in 5 days.</li>
              <li>The platform allows surfacing of notifications to our users via messages in toolbar in response to certain events.</li>
              <li>The events generated in different parts of the system were fed into a Kafka queue.</li>
              <li>Created scalable event consumption and notification generation system using Gearman.</li>
              <li>Used Redis to store notification queues for each user.</li>
              <li>Implemented smart polling with exponential backoff for checking for new notifications in the toolbar (client side).</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Inventory Estimation Tool :s</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Designed the core engine of the inventory estimation tool that is used to estimate the traffic for a given set of targeting criteria ( user attributes like age, gender, location). The system was implemented by other members of the team.</li>
              <li>The engine uses Java Bit Vectors to represent users who visited the site in a given time range and combines vectors in real time to compute the traffic for the selected set of targeting criteria.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Single SignOn For su.pr :        </h4>
            <ul>
              <li>I designed and implemented a Single SignOn(SSO) facility for http://su.pr sister site.</li>
              <li>Its implemented in OO PHP and uses short lived cookie based token for facilitating  SSO across different domains.</li>
              <li>SSO made it possible for publishers to use the same login that they have on  stumbleupon.com on su.pr and reduced the barrier to entry.</li>
              <li>SSO is also used by the support team to log into publishers accounts to help them  with their problems. The support team can do this without having to know the  publisher's account password.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>StumbleUpon Badge & Partner API: </h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Originally conceived the idea of StumbleUpon badge, built a prototype and convinced the product and business development people that we had an attractive product to sell.</li>
              <li>Single handedly designed the whole system(except CSS) from end to end to support the StumbleUpon badge.</li>
              <li>Wrote the JS for the badge and made the badge IFrame based so that it offers very high isolation from the parent page on which it is included.</li>
              <li>Built the security infrastructure to prevent gaming & data scraping. Implemented rate limiting as a measure against DOS attacks.</li>
              <li>Created a highly scalable backend on top of Memcache that acts like a perfect cache i.e. the cache does not depend on timeout to invalidate the data but the data gets invalidated only when the data for the badge actually changes.</li>
              <li>Built a REST API for partners to query our system for information about their urls.</li>
              <li>Worked closely with Partners (HowStuffWorks.com, HuffingtonPost.com, NationalGeorgraphic.com) to get the badge tested and deployed on their site. Provided full pre deployment and post deployment support to partners for launching StumbleUpon badge on their sites.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Analytics & Tracking:         </h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Designed and implemented custom page instrumentation and user tracking infrastructure.</li>
              <li>Implemented cookie based user entry point tracking and goal state (signup) tracking. Created reports to analyze the conversion quality of various user acquisition channels (referrers).</li>
              <li>Created reports to analyze the probability of a user creating an account in response to getting a join invitation from a friend Vs an interesting url shared by a friend.</li>
              <li>Wrote tools in Perl, PHP and used sqlite to process & summarize huge log files.</li>
              <li>Wrote an object oriented reporting framework that has modular and highly reusable widgets. It has widgets like table, date picker , pie charts that can be used in an object oriented way to build reprots.</li>
              <li>Convinced management to switch to Omniture Analytics Suite from Google Analytics.</li>
              <li>Single handedly transitioned all analytics and tracking from Google to Omniture.</li>
              <li>Worked with Product people and instrumented critical flows (e.g. signup flow) in the system and helped do the funnel and drop off analysis.</li>
              <li>Did A/B testing to see how it affected the funnel and drop off reports. Used the learning from these experiments to optimize the signup flow for maximum conversions.  </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Metrics Suite:    </h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Designed and built a metrics and reporting suite that helped us identify and understand various trends in the system like variation in user activity around weekend and holidays, spam activity, a piece of content going viral etc.</li>
              <li>Created a report to measure the effectiveness of our recommendation algorithms over time. The results of this report are being used to fine tune the recommendation engine.</li>
              <li>Due to massive size of datasets involved in these reports I investigated various high performance computing (HPC) & reporting infrastructures like Hadoop (open source framework to run map reduce jobs) & open source business intelligence and OLAP offerings. Convinced the backend infrastructure team and the recommendation engine team to setup and use Hadoop for high performance data analysis.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Set up advanced LAMP dev environment:          </h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Soon after I started at StumbleUpon I created a highly efficient dev environment.</li>

              <li>Configured xdebug on the shared dev server to be able to do remote debugging from personal dev workstations through the PDT Eclipse IDE. Trained people on using xdebug for remote debugging, function tracking and profiling.</li>
              <li>Wrote a custom file system event listener to automate the syncing of files from personal dev workstations to shared dev environment that is triggered by the file save event. Wrote this tool for both Mac OS X and Linux.</li>
              <li>Wrote extensive documentation on setting up and optimizing the dev environment.</li>
            </ul>
